Embaggen
========

Embaggen is a component of the Presence repository system
being built at the University of Kentucky.  It supports a
microservice which consumes batches of loose files and 
wraps them in a BagIt bag.  It uses Francesco Lazzarino's
Ruby BagIt library to do all the real work.

Embaggen consists of a bit of Ruby, ready to be built into
a local gem, plus a small script to drive it.
